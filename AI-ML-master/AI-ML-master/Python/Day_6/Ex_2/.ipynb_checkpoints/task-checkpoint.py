# So that means on line 11, you'll see that I've created the weight_as_integer variable to store the weight input as a whole number.

# On line 16, I'm converting the height that is coming in with height in meters. 
# And because none of us have one meter or two meter, we're usually somewhere in between the two. 
# This is usually represented as a floating point number. So there's a decimal point in there.
